# Estimating home prices with linear regression

### Overview

The premise of this project is to analyze an existing dataset of housing data and sales prices, and from the shoes of a new data scientist who works for Zillow, build a linear regression model to predict unknown house prices. 

Specifically, I look at a feature set which is documented in the following [data dictionary](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt), and determine the entire process of exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

> In my situation, I am a recently hired Zillow empolyee on my first work assignment and am building a model that will make the best possible prediction of home values in Ames, Iowa. I am making a presentation to Zillow's semi-technical staff about the process that led me to my final model and predictions.

### Datasets

- [Training dataset](./data/train.csv): this data contains the training data for the model.
- [Testing dataset](./data/test.csv): this data contains all of the training data for your model. The target variable (SalePrice) is removed from the test set.
- [Predicted housing prices](./data/predictions.csv): This data contains the predicted prices generated by the model using the test data set. It has been formatter in a Kaggle-friendly manner.



### Deliverables

- A Jupyter notebook, [HB_project-2.ipynb](./HB_project-2.ipynb), for which a structured format was provided, that describes and imolements the model-building process. The notebook also contains functions that are used within the file.
- A README markdown file [this file](./README.md) that provides an introduction to and an overview of the project.
- A presentation [slideshow](./HB_project_2_ames.pdf) rendered as a .pdf file. The included presentation, intended for a non-technical audience, was presented to the class on November 20th, 2018.
- A data file contianing the predicted housing prices: [predicted house prices](./data/predictions.csv)

- Future improvement


Linear regression process

- Gather, clean, and explore data
    - Load dataset
    - Null and bad values
    - Ordinal and categorical
- Split data and select features
    - Train / test split
    - Feature selection
- Build, evaluate, and improve model
    - Instantiate
    - Fit and predict
    - Evaluate

Data categories

- Numeric: 
    - Ordinary values
    - Continuous or discrete
    - Sq. feet, bedrooms 
    - *Leave as-is*
- Nominal
    - Discrete number of categories
    - Numeric or non-numeric
    - Zoning, type of dwelling
    - Dummify
- Ordinal 
    - Ordering matters
    - Numeric or non-numeric
    - Lot Shape, overall condition
    - Ordered map
- Feature selection
    - Absolute correlations of features w.r.t. target variable
- Model, fit, predict, evaluate
    - Choose model: 
        - KFold
        - LassoCV
        - alphas=np.logspace(0, 5, 200)
    - Fit and predict:
        - StandardScaler
        - PolynomialFeatures
    - Evaluate
        - Compare train and test
        - R-squared, RMSE
        - Delta (train / test)
- Future improvement
    - Tuning
        - GridSearchCV
    - Feature Engineering
        - Log transformation
        - Imputing via kNN
        - PCA
